## Introduction
Text Mining is one of the most interested topic in data mining and has many future potential use cases. Text mining itself is an unsupervised learning technique, which usually involves extracting patterns and trends through statistical pattern learning. Many uses of text mining include text categorization, text clustering, concept extraction, or sentiment analysis. This project mainly deals with text topic, which is a form of supervised learning used to determine the topics that summarize closely related words.

We will use the example of Frozen rating reviews, and determine what people are talking about the movie based on the customers' text reviews.
