## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate the use of different charts and graphs in examining the World Bank indicators. Users can interact by exploring the tabs on the left and choosing countries/indicators of their interests. The dataset is obtained from the [World Bank Group](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator), using the wbstats library in R. This dataset contains socio-economics variables of all countries in the world in the past 50 years. Data was cleansed, formatted, and subset from 2000 to 2015.
