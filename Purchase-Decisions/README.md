# Purchase Decision
This problem mainly deals with the problem of imbalanced dataset in the framework of decision tree and random forest model. In many binary classification problem, one class is usually presented more frequently than the other class. As a result, if we use the original dataset to predict a binary target variable, the result might seem to just ignore one class.
Oversampling in data analysis are used to adjust the class distribution of a dataset to correct for the bias in the original dataset by selecting more samples from one class than the other. We will examine in detail SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling technique by looking at its usage and implications for a binary classification problem.
