       " \"the year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of h g wells' great novel , war of the worlds this is perhaps the least well known and very probably the best of them no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it , but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place the last year of the 19th century , 1900 using wells' original setting , in and near woking , england br br imdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as spoilers that might apply with some films , where the ending might actually be a surprise , but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world , it seems positively silly i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature , so let 's get right to the chase the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease , against which they have no immunity if that 's a spoiler , so be it after a book and 3 other films \\\\( including the 1953 classic \\\\) , you ought to know how this ends br br this film , which follows wells' plot in the main , is also very cleverly presented in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th early 20th century photography although filmed in a widescreen aspect , the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs \\\\( rather than black \\\\) colors are often reminiscent of hand tinting at other times , colors are washed out these variations are typical of early films , which did n't use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality , even going from black white to sepia white to blue white to reddish white and so on as you 'll see on occasion here the special effects are deliberately retrograde , of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic feel some of effects are really awkward such as the destruction of big ben the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd , particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair br br this film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells' original narrative as has been noted viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story wells' description of the martians a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles is effectively portrayed when the martian machines appear , about an hour into the film , they too give a good impression of how wells described them both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective \\\\( primarily \\\\) of rural england plus a few scenes in london \\\\( involving the narrator 's brother \\\\) the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark \\\\( big ben \\\\) , but at least does n't dwell unduly on the devastation of london br br the victory of the martians is hardly a surprise , despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines the narrator , traveling about to seek escape , sees much of what wells terms the rout of mankind he encounters a curate endowed with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest , where they discover an awful fact the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene wells adds that after eating they set up a prolonged and cheerful hooting the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder \\\\( cheers from the gallery british curates are so often utterly insufferable \\\\) br br this film lasts almost 3 hours , going through wells' story in welcome detail it 's about time the author got his due in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact a word about the acting do n't expect award winning performances they 're not bad , however , the actors are earnest and they grow on you most of them , however , have had very abbreviated film careers , often only in this film the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana , in his 2nd film the curate is john kaufman also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing the brother \\\\( henderson \\\\) is played with some conviction by w bernard bauman in his first film the artilleryman , the only other sizable part , is played by james lathrop in his first film br br this is overall a splendid film , portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it despite its slight defects , it is far and away better than any of its hyped up competitors if you want to see h g wells' war of the worlds and not some wholly distorted version of it see this film !\",\n",

the murders seem not entirely out of place but of course they were as president kennedy reminded us , `we all cherish the futures of our children' br br citizenx communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply serial rapists rape to dominate serial killers kill to dominate so do some soldiers such `limbic dominators' make poor humans br br

executions merely guarantee society 's failure to learn from the complex reality of victims' deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of how why they died nor do killers learn regret if they

boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told they do n't take any chances whatsoever , and they are extremely predictable after you 've watched a fair amount of american films domino 's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking , oh man , they 're screwed now and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films it has a lot of depth to it , in my opinion , and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it overall , this is what kept me so interested in the movie br br characters br br i felt that the characters were accurate knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman , who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that br br choco was also very believable , his use of spanish in inappropriate situations , his reactions to domino 's lack of affection , as well as his jealousy issues within the team they all rang true to me , which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic br br rourke 's character was the least interesting to me , but it still rang true to me he seemed like an ordinary guy , trying to make ends meet i hope that 's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that 's what i got out of it he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes , yet is still trying to live br br claremont ladies i believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story they were n't just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley , these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal you could empathize with them because , to them , this child 's illness was a problem with no other solution these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help br br the mobsters they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can and i really liked that part they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting br br christopher walken 90210 guys br br they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie from walken 's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has beens their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable br br cinematography yes the cinematography this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans but in my opinion i thought it was genius , the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement , just like anything else i both applaud and congratulate scott , the editor , the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie not only did they go far and above with its presentation , they went that much further the use of colors , both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob , bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life is n't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else if you notice , in times of less stress or conflict , there were very few camera tricks if any at all this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and were n't just doing it for the heck of it i realize that most people who watched this movie were n't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach hollywood films have grown predictable and bland most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns and i'm glad that scott tried to make something different br br granted , this movie is n't for everyone , but to say it 's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i'm glad that i spent the money for it i would recommend this to all , but i'm sure it will only hit a chord with few i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of mtv' wo n't appreciate this movie , but i think many people will we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique and with that in mind , i think he succeeded tremendously\",\n",

up is nothing to sneeze at , and in conjunction , the line up makes anchors aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws br br sinatra and kelly are clarence doolittle and joseph brady , respectively , two navy men as the film begins , they 're just pulling in to the los angeles area for some much needed leave brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named lola doolittle is still a bit wet behind the ears , appropriately enough , and seeks advice on women from brady in private \\\\( publicly , scriptwriter isobel lennart and sidney have all of the navy men comically exaggerating their finesse with women to each other \\\\) brady promises to help get doolittle hooked up , but primarily because doolittle wo n't leave him alone otherwise a kink is put into their plans when local police basically force them to assist with a young boy who is obsessed with the navy he wo n't give the police any information about who he is or where he lives brady helps and he and doolittle end up taking the boy back home when the boy 's guardian , susan abbott \\\\( grayson \\\\) , finally shows up , doolittle goes gaga for her brady tries to convince him to forget about her brady just wants to get back to lola but they keep getting coaxed back to abbott 's home , and eventually something of a love triangle forms things become more complicated when brady lies about doolittle knowing a famous musician , jose iturbi , who is in residence at a film studio , and claims that doolittle has set up an audition for abbott , who is a singer and actress , in front of iturbi br br because of the story , the music is a strange combination of militaristic music because of the navy premise , obviously , broadway pop what the stars tend to sing in more informal settings , opera what abbott 's character excels at , liberace like popular classical what iturbi did , and mexican music because abbott frequents a mexican restaurant in a mexican section of l a the combination does n't work as well as it could plenty of the songs are good , and everyone involved is certainly talented as a singer or musician , but the genre hopping tends to lose coherence worse , there are a couple showcases for iturbi , who was apparently a big star at the time , that effectively bring the plot to a halt and that seem more than a bit hokey at this point in time i just watched another film that happened to have outstanding music , robert altman 's kansas city \\\\( 1996 \\\\) , but that misguidedly stopped the plot to periodically turn into a concert film anchors aweigh takes a similar tactic yes , this is a musical , but there 's a difference between songs that propel and are integral to the plot and concert showcases that seem like contractual obligation material br br there are also some plot problems it 's not very well established why brady is so against doolittle 's pursuit of abbott we can guess that brady thinks doolittle should n't become involved with someone who has to take care of a kid , and who seems relatively proper and traditional , but on the other hand , brady can tell that doolittle does n't have the same womanizing disposition that brady admits of himself abbott seems like a good fit for doolittle , and furthermore , lennart works hard to establish that brady just wants to get doolittle out of his hair and get on with meeting lola it seems that brady 's character should be quickly pawning doolittle off on any candidate , whether she 's a good fit or not this might seem like a minor detail , but it 's actually the hinge for about a third to half of the plot the story also seems a bit drawn out length is a problem anchors aweigh , clocking in at roughly two hours and twenty minutes , should have been cut down by at least a half hour br br the above surely sounds like i'm complaining about the film too much to justify an 8 i just wanted to stress what i see as flaws , because the conventional wisdom on anchors aweigh is much closer to the idea that it has no flaws br br sinatra , kelly and grayson are certainly charismatic , separately and together they turn in good , interesting performances sinatra looks and acts much younger than his actual age of 29 30 while shooting he plays an unusually na ve , virginal character completely different than most of the roles he would take later , and different than his public image as a crooner for kelly , this was his breakthrough film , and rightfully so his choreography is varied and impressive , as is his acting grayson is charming , her performance is sophisticatedly understated , and she 's simply gorgeous all of this helps override the flaws with the script and the drawn out pacing br br and there 's even a very interesting element that probably only arises because sidney was allowed to sprawl over a large variety of moods the infamous kelly dance with jerry the mouse \\\\( of tom and jerry fame \\\\) in an extended fantasy sequence this is one of the earliest examples of combining live action and animation , and it is extremely well done and enjoyable as long as you 're a fan of fantasy the fantasy sequences tend to be the best of the film matched in excellence to the dance with jerry the mouse is a long song and dance number featuring kelly and grayson , where brady is imagining abbott in a scene from a period film while he woos her , having to resort to acrobatic stunts to reach her physically as she stands on a high balcony br br as uneven and flawed as the film is , it is largely successful and entertaining to watch fans of classic musicals certainly should n't miss

       " \"by now you 've probably heard a bit about the new disney dub of miyazaki 's classic film , laputa castle in the sky during late summer of 1998 , disney released kiki 's delivery service on video which included a preview of the laputa dub saying it was due out in 1999 it 's obviously way past that year now , but the dub has been finally completed and it 's not laputa castle in the sky , just castle in the sky for the dub , since laputa is not such a nice word in spanish \\\\( even though they use the word laputa many times throughout the dub \\\\) you 've also probably heard that world renowned composer , joe hisaishi , who scored the movie originally , went back to rescore the excellent music with new arrangements laputa came out before my neighbor totoro and after nausicaa of the valley of the wind , which began studio ghibli and it 's long string of hits and in my opinion , i think it 's one of miyazaki 's best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four minute gem laputa castle in the sky is a film for all ages and i urge everyone to see it br br for those unfamiliar with castle in the sky 's story , it begins right at the start and does n't stop for the next two hours the storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted , you see miyazaki 's true vision and believe me , it 's one fantastic one the film begins with sheeta , a girl with one helluva past as she is being held captive by the government on an airship sheeta holds the key to laputa , the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization the key to laputa is a sacred pendant she has which is sought by many , namely the government , the military and the air pirate group , the dola gang \\\\( who sheeta and pazu later befriend \\\\) soon , the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid she falls a few thousand feet , but the fall is soft and thanks to her pendant as she floats down from the sky , pazu , an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines , sees sheeta and catches her the two become fast friends , but thanks to her pendant , the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the dola gang and government try to capture sheeta one action sequence after another , we learn all of the character 's motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it 's fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue plus somewhat twisty surprise i think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time the story is wonderful , as we peak into hayao miyazaki 's animation which has no limits the setting of the film is a combo of many time periods it does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s , but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons laputa is also surprisingly a funny film the film has tons of hilarious moments , almost equal to the drama and action the film holds i think the funniest part is a fight scene where pazu 's boss faces off against a pirate , and soon after a riot breaks out it 's funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly br br now let 's talk about how the dub rates an excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life teen heartthrob james van der beek plays the hero pazu , who has a much more mature voice then in the japanese version , where in the original he sounded more childlike either way , i think his voice is a nice fit with pazu anna paquin , the young oscar winner from the piano , plays sheeta this is also a nice performance , but the voice is a bit uneven , she does n't stay true to one accent at times she sounds as american as apple pie , but at other times she sounds like someone from new zealand the performance i most enjoyed however was of coris leachman , who played mama dola not only is this an excellent performance , but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life if there was ever a live action laputa movie \\\\( g d forbid \\\\) , she would be the one to play her , you can just imagine her in the role \\\\( well , somewhat \\\\) luke skywalker himself , mark hamill is muska , and this is another top rate hamill performance you may be familiar with hamill from a long line of voice work after he did the original star wars movies , but he renders muska to full evil his voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the joker , who he played for many episodes on the animated batman series rounding out the cast is voice character actor jim cummings , who does a great , gruff job as the general and andy dick and mandy patakin as members of the dola gang br br now let me talk about what really makes this dub special , joe hisaishi 's newly arranged music ! for those who have never heard of him , mr hisaishi does the music and like all of miyazaki 's films , the music is very memorable each of his scores has it 's own personas which fits the particular film perfectly now , these new arrangements he has done are more american like , which i think was the goal of the new recordings do n't worry , the classic tunes of the japanese version are still here in great form the score , to me , sounds to be arranged like this is a hollywood blockbuster it has more power , it has more emphasis , it 's clearer and deeper the film 's prologue , the first seconds where we are introduced to the airships , has some new music \\\\( i am not sure , but i believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all \\\\) but a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy things seem very enhanced in a powerful scene , the music is more stronger then in the original versions in a calm scene , it 's more calmer overall , i think many of you will be pleased with the new arrangements an mixes , i highly did myself , and personally think it helps improve the film i prefer the new score over the old one , and i hope disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack br br another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful , and much of the original japanese lines are intact in kiki , i'm sure a few lines where changed , and this is the same way , lines have been changed but a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue miyazaki has written i was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered , but they were there intact some new lines have been added as well which help out but i am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing , disney did not translate the ending song , it was in japanese i was mortified when they did completely new songs for the kiki dub , but with this version it 's the original song in japanese so i guess it 's good it 's still the original , but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak english br br there is a big down side to this dub , and it deals with how the voices match the character 's lips of course in any dub it wo n't be perfect , but i think in kiki and mononoke the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed \\\\( and disney had a little bit more time with this one \\\\) some of the time everything matches perfect , some of the time it does n't completley match , and in a rare case , someone says something and the lips do n't move at all \\\\( there 's a scene where sheeta chuckles and her mouth does n't move one bit \\\\) br br as far as things about the film itself , these are my thoughts i thought the most amazing part of laputa was the animation from the opening sequence to the ending , the animation is so lush and detailed , you just have to watch in awe you see the true nature of each character , true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action you have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn , it 's like a moving piece of art and to think , this was done in the mid 1980 's the animation is quite different from disney , ghibli has it 's own distinctive flare which is very different , but very good and after all these years , the colors look as vibrant as ever laputa also has tons of action sequences , lots of plane dogfights plus a few on ground these sequences are so well done and so intriguing , it 's scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film and the finale is just something you must see the sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions , guns firing and everything else well and like all miyazaki films , each one focuses on a different theme \\\\( i g kiki confidence \\\\) this one has a great a lesson on greed and power people do n't realize how greed can take over you , and how having too much power is n't good people are obsessed with power , and are greedy , and the main villian , muska , greatly shows this br br all in all , laputa castle in the sky was a great film to begin with , and is now improved for the most part i am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all it 's glory with a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent redone musical score from joe hisaishi , disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy though i think the voices matched the mouths better in the kiki and princess mononoke disney dubs , castle in the sky is still a great dub and is worth the long delays because now more can expierence a fantastic film\",\n",

anger from the one you love cheating for years , or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world , love hurts the great thing about this film , however , is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go , but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future no one in this drama is perfect they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they ca n't free themselves from alone there is some heavy subject material here and i credit binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe , but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character based and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how 9 11 effected us all , ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret br br this is a new career performance for adam sandler i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish , pent up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically the juvenility of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and potty humor , but also can be used to show a repressed man , shy and shutout to the world around him a man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell anderson let sandler do just that in his masterpiece punch drunk love and mike binder has taken it one step further sandler plays former dentist charlie fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the world trade center on 9 11 that one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result , he became reclusive and started to believe he could n't remember anything that happened before that day he really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him , those that love him , try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family , he goes through life with his ipod and headphones , shutting out everything so as not to be tempted remember br br reign over me is not about charlie fineman though , it is about dentist and family man alan johnson a man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony , johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate charlie does played perfectly by the always brilliant don cheadle , johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life he has no friends and when he sees charlie , by chance , one day , his life evolves into something he has n't felt in 15 years he revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family cheadle 's character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and sandler 's does n't mind because all that was before he met his wife the two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives once they begin opening up though , it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the fa ade they have created for themselves br br the supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads jada pinkett smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely , but it is her final scene on the phone with cheadle that really showed me something different and true liv tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist , but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting , perfect casting the many small cameos are also effective , even writer director mike binder 's role as sandler 's old best friend and accountant , \\\\( my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere , considering it is his film \\\\) last but not least is the beautiful saffron burrows she is a great actress and plays the love crushed divorc e trying to put her life back together wonderfully a role that seems comic relief at first , but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to come br br binder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies i have seen in a long time the direction is almost flawless , \\\\( the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore background really annoyed me in the beginning \\\\) , the acting superb , and the story true to itself , never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion even the music was fantastic and used to enhance , not to lead us emotionally , \\\\( why after two great uses of the titular song by the who did binder feel the need to use the inferior eddie veddar remake for the end , i do n't know , but it did unfortunately stick out for me \\\\) reign over me is a film about

       " \"i saw this film at the toronto international film festival filmed during an actual qualifying match for the 2006 world cup , offside works brilliantly as both a comedy and a tragedy the film follows the fortunes of a group of young women who are caught trying to sneak into a football match at tehran 's azadi stadium the country 's islamic religious leaders have decreed that women may not sit with men at sporting events , lest they be exposed to cursing and other morally questionable behaviour this has n't stopped the country 's young female fans , who continue to sneak in using various tricks but panahi focuses on a small group who have been caught and are being detained agonizingly close to the action they beg the bored soldiers guarding them to let them go or at least to let them watch the match the soldiers tell them they should n't have tried to get in , that they could have watched the game at home on tv they banter back and forth in almost real time as the game continues , just off camera br br there is one very funny sequence where a young soldier accompanies one of the girls to the restroom since there are no female restrooms at stadiums , he has to clear the room of any men before he can allow her to go in plus , he makes her cover her face so no one can see she 's a woman this is accomplished using a poster of iranian soccer star ali daei as a mask , with eye holes punched out br br you get a real sense that even the soldiers are baffled by the prohibition , and are only carrying out their orders so as to hasten the end of their compulsory military service one soldier complains that he was supposed to be on leave so he could take care of his family 's cattle in the countryside little by little , the girls and the soldiers talk to each other , and there are numerous small acts of kindness on both sides to show that these are basically good people living in terrible circumstances however , the soldiers' constant reminder that the chief is on his way lends a sense of menace , since we do n't know what sort of punishment the women will face br br unlike most iranian films , which are known for their strong visuals , offside is filmed in a realist style with no artifice in fact , the film was made during the actual qualifying match against bahrain that took place on june 5 , 2005 the plot in many ways was determined by the result on the pitch if iran won the match , they would qualify if they lost , they would not since the world cup has come and gone , i do n't think it is a spoiler to say that iran won the match the scenes of celebration at the end of the film were real and spontaneous , which gave the film a real authenticity seeing how much this meant to the people of iran was deeply touching br br as well , one of the young women makes reference at the end of the film to seven fans who died during the iran japan match on march 25 , just a few weeks before they were trampled to death after police began to spray the crowd with water to move them in a certain direction knowing that this was a real life tragedy added another level of poignancy to the celebrations br br i do n't want to go off on a long political tangent , but this film gave me real hope that there are those in iran who are hoping for change and working at it iran is a nation of young people , and it is only a matter of time before they take the place of their elders in the political sphere films like this one show the proud spirit of the iranian people in spite of their present difficulties , and it 's my sincere hope that there is a brighter future for them\",\n",

       " \"the 63 year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history on the one hand , her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes , and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront , director jean marc vall e who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victoria 's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy it 's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background , and yet that 's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare br br taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert , the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure 's entire life , vall e instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victoria 's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like , yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story , writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal vall e takes this and runs , making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching br br a major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800 's regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films everything from the costume designs , sets , hair styles , lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victoria 's story without ever over encumbering it indeed , while watching vall e 's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element and then there 's the film 's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes' script entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and albert 's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with , but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeri 's original work just as well br br yet for all the poignant compositions , lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene , the single most important factor here and indeed to most period dramas are the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that between the sweet , budding romance of victoria \\\\( emily blunt \\\\) and albert \\\\( rupert friend \\\\) and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like \\\\( spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany \\\\) , the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowe 's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic nice to look at but dim underneath affair so common with these outings br br in the end , it 's hard to fault a work such as the young victoria it 's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance , plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details of course , it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable vall e never seems to be striving for grandeur , nor does he seem content at making a run of the mill escapist piece for aficionados somewhere within this gray middle ground lies the young victoria , sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions beautiful , memorable but most of all , human br br a review by jamie robert ward \\\\( http www invocus net \\\\)\",\n",

imagined they come to realize that these people from their mother 's past are , indeed , real br br the story shifts , basically , between 1953 and circa 2000 with a few glimpses at ann 's life between those years it was in 1953 that ann met the love of her life and experienced her life 's greatest tragedy br br one of ann 's two best friends from college , lila , is being married ann 's other best friend is lila 's brother , buddy lila and buddy are the children of a rich newport family , whereas ann is a cabaret singer living in greenwich village who wants to be a free spirit but is

three harris he is the adult son of a former servant of the family who grew up with lila and buddy and has gone on to become a physician in a small new england town ann immediately becomes enamored of harris which adds a complication to the fact that lila has always been in love with harris and continues to be buddy , also , is in love with harris , but being 1953 , he has redirected that homosexual desire for harris to his good friend , ann for he cannot admit to himself that he has a sexual craving for another man buddy exhibits his inner frustration outwardly by being the alcoholic , wise cracking bad boy of the family much to the chagrin of his very proper and uptight parents br br needless to say , all of these expressed and repressed emotions lead to tragedy after all this is a chick flick br br in the present time , ann 's daughters have become distant from their mother and are suffering their own life realizations and doubts constance is working to emotional exhaustion trying to keep up her roll as perfect mother and wife nina , having always felt inferior , cannot maintain a relationship br br stir all of these relationships into a span of fifty years , and you get an intriguing look at society , its values , and its effects upon the personalities and actions of the complex people involved br br all of the acting in evening is excellent , but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes along with two unique family relationships that make this film so very , very special br br claire danes plays the 1950 's ann , and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is conflicted by what she is supposed to do as opposed to what she wants to do her performance is not easily forgettable br br vanessa redgrave plays the dying ann whose mind shifts from the present , to the past , to flights of fantasy , and of course , redgrave pulls it all off with sterling style br br natasha richardson redgrave 's real daughter plays ann 's daughter , constance , in the film the scenes between this real life mother and daughter playing fictional mother and daughter are an insightful treat to watch br br toni collette plays ann 's other daughter , nina nina spends a good deal of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while shutting out a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister collette is perfect for a part such as this , but i have never seen her give a bad or unbelievable performance no matter what part she plays br br mamie gummer plays 1950 's lila and shows us a woman even more conflicted of her expected role in life than her good friend , ann she is very good br br meryl streep gummer 's mother plays present day lila what is there to say about meryl streep other than she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance br br director lajos koltai states in the dvd extras that he sought out glenn close to play the relatively small part of lila 's mother because he felt she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the film he certainly was right , and close 's performance in that one scene etches it in your mind all the other scenes in which close is lila 's very proper mother , and you get another performance to treasure br br there are three other scenes in the film , combined with the one featuring close described above , that make the whole movie worth watching on lila 's wedding day , ann comes into her room and crawls into to bed with her friend to discuss lila 's misforgivings about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love this scene is repeated fifty years later when lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend ann to talk about the lives they have lived in this latter scene , streep and redgrave are enthralling br br the other memorable scene at least to me is when buddy declares his love for ann hugh dancy as buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings his performance is superior br br chick flick \\\\? yes a very special film with unbelievable acting , directing , and scenery \\\\? definitely i cannot recommend evening too much\",\n",
