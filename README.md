# Collection of personal data exploration/ML projects

## Introduction
This repo contains my personal project related to data science, including visualization, predictive models, machine learning techniques. I started these projects back when I was styding my Master's and maintained as I started full time job. The main purpose of this Git is to refine my data sciences techniques. 

## Datasets
Some of the dataset are obtained while I was in school, while others are obtained from public repositories such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## Approaches
My approach to a data science problem usually contains of:
1. Define problem statement
2. Data cleaning
3. Assess initial observations of the data
4. Model building
5. Conclusion

In most data science problems, I found step 1 extremely important. A lot of time I found myself struggling with the data and coming back to the first step to redefine the problem statement. This is also important in real world situation where you have to clearly define your team or your clients' expectation before jumping into examining data and building models, otherwise you are wasting time and resources.

## Notes
Please feel free to comment on any of the project, I would love to learn more from your inputs. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/namhp/)
